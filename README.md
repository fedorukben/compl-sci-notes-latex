# Computation Science I Blank Notes LaTeX [MATH2072U/CSCI2072U]

Thank-you for using these notes! I will be posting notes **after** lectures. The slides are usually posted the day of the lecture, so it is too short of a deadline for me to feasibly post the LaTeX/PDFs before lectures. 

Since Lecture 01 was not really relevant, I am not typing it up. We didn't cover any new content.

Also, if you notice any problems or possible improvements to my LaTeX, please feel free to message me over Slack, or through Discord (@benfedoruk#8525), or via email (ben@benfedoruk.com).
